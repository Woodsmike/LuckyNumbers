Develop a console application that will be a lucky numbers guessing game similar to the lottery. The user will choose a range of numbers and then try to guess all 6 of the numbers that will be randomly generated within the range. The user will win a portion of the jackpot based on the number of numbers guessed correctly.

Tasks

Part 1

 Ask the user for a starting number for the lowest number in the number range.
 Ask the user for an ending number for the highest number in the number range.
 Ask the user to guess the 6 numbers the user thinks will be the lucky numbers generated within the number range.
 Numbers must be stored in an array
 Array must be populated using a loop
 If the user enters a number that is outside of the range set, prompt the user to give you a valid number. Do this until the user enters a valid number.
Part 2

 The program should randomly generate 6 numbers using a loop
 The randomly generated numbers should be stored in an array
 Numbers should be displayed to the console as such and using a loop (Numbers below are for example only. Format must be exact):
Lucky Number: 12
Lucky Number: 47
Lucky Number: 28
Lucky Number: 3
Lucky Number: 19
Lucky Number: 35
Part 3

 Hard-code a value for the jackpot amount and let the user know what the jackpot amount is at some point you decide in the program.
 The program should count the number of correctly guessed numbers and output to the console to notify the user. Example:
You guessed 3 numbers correctly!
 The program should calculate the user's winnings based on the number of numbers guessed correctly.
 The user's winnings should be output to the console. Example:
You won $256,877.23!
Part 4

 Ask the user if the user would like to play again.
 If the user says yes, then the program should run again from the beginning.
 If the user says no, then the program should say "Thanks for playing!" (Must be exact statement).
Stretch Tasks:

 Make your program ensure none of the generated numbers are repeated. For example, the following is a valid output:
Lucky Number: 12
Lucky Number: 47
Lucky Number: 28
Lucky Number: 3
Lucky Number: 19
Lucky Number: 35
But, the following output is invalid because 12 is generated twice.
Lucky Number: 12
Lucky Number: 47
Lucky Number: 28
Lucky Number: 3
Lucky Number: 19
Lucky Number: 12
If there is a repeated number, replace it with a new number. Do this until there are no repeated numbers.
